# Hello world

## Objectives
* Experiment with the console
* Learn to write a simple program following Python best practices

---

During the prep work, you got familiar at writing Python. Our goal here is to help you leverage those notions and use them on real working projects.

IPython is a REPL, it:

1. **R**eads the expression written by the user, which can be any valid Python expression like `"input"`, `2 + 2`, `"Area".lower()`...
1. **E**valuates the result of this expression
1. **P**rints this result
1. **L**oops back to point 1, waiting for a new user input.

You can launch `IPython` by typing `ipython` in your terminal.

Once you start the console, you should see a few lines displayed, including the version of Python you're running.
```
Python 3.6.6 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Jul 26 2018, 09:55:02)
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 6.5.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

**[TODO]** Experiment the following lines in the console:

* `40 + 2`
* `type(42)`
* `type("A string")`
* `"A String".lower()`
* "hello" + "world"

---

## Guidelines
* Open the `hello_world.py` file with your text editor
* Your mission is to implement a simple program that just print out `Hello,
  world!`

Good luck!
