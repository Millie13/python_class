## Background & objectives
* Write your first useful program!
* Understand how to use `input` to get user's input
* Solidify your Python's foundations: format strings, type cast, use string
  operations and perform arithmetics operations

In this module, you'll write your first real program in Python. **And we will
guide you to write a proper program**.

## What we're going to code
This is a simple program that ask the user for its name, its height and weight
and returns the user's [BMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) in a nicely formatted manner.

As you can see in the wikipedia article, the BMI is computed this way:
```
weight(kg) / height(meters)**2
```

## Our program

Here's how our program will look like to the user (**be careful with the units**):
```
What's your name? georges
How tall are you (in cm)? 193
How much do you weight (in kg)? 96
```

Our program will then write this to the console:
```
Hello Georges, your BMI is 25.77!
```

## Instructions

Open the `bmi_calculator.py` file in the `src` directory and follow along the
instructions.

You can execute your code by executing `python src/bmi_calculator.py` in your terminal.
